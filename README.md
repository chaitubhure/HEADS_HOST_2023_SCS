# HEADS_HOST_2023_SCS

Python code for Supply Chain Security Machine Learning Competition. Implemented the concept of transfer learning utilizing the VGG 16 model to identify authentic vs counterfiet ICs. 

Code comments and instructions to run the code are in the created Colab Notebook to train, test, load a trained model to generate predictions on test data as well as visualize the predictions.

CNN_Implementation1.ipynb -- Python Notebook created for Phase 1
CNN_Implementation_Phase2.ipynb -- Python Notebook created for Phase 2
Predictions on Holdout Data.ipynb -- Python Notebook created for Holdout Data. This notebook will also help you to visualize predictions as well as visualize model layers' activation functions
